Since blitz++ is an integral part of this framework we distribute a version
known to work with the framework itself.

We have a forked copy of blitz here:
https://github.com/ReFRACtor/blitz

We created a fork so we can maintain a version that works with our software
ahead of our pull requests getting pulled into the main repository at:
https://github.com/blitzpp/blitz

Generally we are compatible with the upstream and will pull upstream changes
into our fork as necessary.
