This is a forward model created by the test "test_create_underlying_fm_xml"
found in the omi repository. This is a StandardForwardModel that uses
PressureWithCloudHandling and GroundWithCloudHandling that we can use
for the ForwardModelWithCloudHandling testing. This forward model could
get created in C++, but it would be a bit involved. Since it is much
easier in python, we just create it that do a write_shelve.

The test can be run again to regenerate the data if needed (e.g.,
an incompatible format change). Or worse case we can rework the unit test
for ForwardModelWithCloudHandling.
