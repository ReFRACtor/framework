This directory contains a shortened set of ABSCO files with only the wavenumbers
used by the default short unit tests. The long tests enabled by the L2_FP_LONG_CHECK=1 or
L2_FP_REALLY_LONG_CHECK=1 environment variables will fail with the short ABSCO files distributed
with the framework source code. 

For running the long and very long tests obtain the full length ABSCO files distributed
as a seperate repository and use the ABSCO_DIR cmake variable to point to this directory.
