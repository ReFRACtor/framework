  This class maintains the ground portion of the state.

  Other objects may depend on the ground, and should be updated
  when the ground is updated. To facilitate that, this class in
  an Oberverable, and objects can add themselves as Observers to be
  notified when the ground is updated.

  This class is unfortunately a bit hard coded. The surface types are
  one of a set of enumerations. The surface parameters depend on
  exactly what the surface type is. These types and parameters map to
  types and parameters found in the LIDORT and LRAD code, so the hard
  coding is intrinsic.
