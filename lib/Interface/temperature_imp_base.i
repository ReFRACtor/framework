// Note, at least for SWIG 2.0.4 a class that is derived from in python 
// needs to declare every virtual function that can be called on it, even 
// if all that happens is the base class to a director is called. This is 
// because this class is used to create the SwigDirector class, and this 
// class needs each of the member functions to direct things properly. It 
// is *not* necessary to add these function to the underlying
// C++, only that you declare them here.
//
// If you miss something, then you will get something like a recursion
// error in python when a virtual function is used that isn't explicitly
// listed here.
//
// This seems like a bug in 2.0.4, if SWIG needs all the member functions
// it should know to make them itself. So perhaps a future version of SWIG
// won't have this same constraint. But for now, this is required.
