/// \brief The base class for all iterative optimizers
///
/// This class is the base class for iterative optimizers.  No
/// derivatives of any order appear in the class implementation
/// because not all optimization problem solvers require 
/// derivatives.
///
/// An iterative solver, during the process of minimizing a 
/// cost function, moves from one point to the next in the 
/// parameter space.  After computing a step, some optimization 
/// algorithms use some criteria to decide whether or not to
/// take the step and to move to the next point.
/// In the context of the class hierarchy rooted at this
/// class, a step that is taken is called an accepted step,
/// and a step that is not taken is called a rejected step.
/// All the classes of the hierarchy that implement the solve()
/// method must correctly record all the points and their associated
/// cost function values after taking accepted steps only.  The 
/// initial starting point and its cost value must also be recorded.
///
/// This class is not associated with any problem (from the 
/// problem class hierarchy).  Problems may appear in different
/// formats (even if equivalent): residual/Jacobian, 
/// cost-function/gradient, cost-function only ...
