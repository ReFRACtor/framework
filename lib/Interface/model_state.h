///
/// This class is used as a state for a mathematical model and not an
/// optimization problem.
///
/// Given NLLSProblemState class it appears thath ModelState is redundant.
/// After all, both classes just are designed to maintain a vector
/// function and its Jacobian.  Then why do we have two similar
/// classes that are only different in their names or the names of
/// some of their members?
///
/// A parametrized mathematical model is not an optimization problem
/// by itself; however, it is a component of an optimization problem
/// when we try to fit the model to measured data.
///
/// When a parametrized mathematical model appears in an optimization
/// problem in the form of a Nonlinear Least Squares problem, the
/// vector model function and its Jacobian are not the same as the
/// vector residual function of the NLLS problem and its Jacobian.
/// They are different, and they are very different when we use 
/// some statistical analysis method to fit the model to the measured
/// data.  In my judgment, emphasizing the 
/// differences and avoiding confusion are more important than 
/// redundancy in this case; therefore, I implemented ModelState
/// as well as NLLSProblemState.
